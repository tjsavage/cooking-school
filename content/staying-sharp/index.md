* **Paring knife** - I don't think I've ever used a paring knife at home; now I can't live without it. This small blade is perfect for precisely cutting small vegetables - think cherry tomatoes, or garlic, or shallots. But it's also a general workhorse - it fits so nicely in your palm, that it becomes and extension of your fingures. I use it to peel things like tomatoes - slipping the tip under the skin of the tomato, and peeling away between my thumb and the blade. I use it to trim poached eggs, and cube butter. Even away from actual ingredients, it's useful - I cut twine and plastic wrap with it.
* **Filleting knife** - This long, thin, flexible knife is the only way to properly fillet a fish. Crucially, the blade can bend - allowing it to fit the contours of a bone to allow you to slice away meat with minimal wastage. It also is thin enough to slide right along the skin of a fish, making it easy to remove skin from flesh.
* **Boning knife** - The boning knife is thin and long like the filleting knife, but rigid - allow you to slice away firmer meats and poultry from bone (rather than more delicate fish). It's also suitable for cutting through thicker sinews and fat that you'll find in large cuts of meat.
